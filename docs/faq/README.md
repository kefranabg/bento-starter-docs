# FAQ

## What about push notifications ?

You can easily add push notifications to your bento project with [firebase cloud messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/)

## What if I need to run code in a secure context (not on client side) ? For example trigger business logic when a client do a CRUD operation ?
